Theoretical Assignments:

1. Write an essay: Importance of Data Cleaning in Data Science

-Data cleaning, also known as data scrubbing, is an essential process in data science that transforms raw, often messy, data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling

Inconsistencies: Ensuring data is formatted consistently (e.g., dates, currency) and using standardized terminology. 

Errors: Detecting and correcting typos, incorrect values, or data entry mistakes.
 
Missing values: Handling situations where data is incomplete or missing, either by removing the incomplete data points, imputing them, or making assumptions.
 
Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate entries to prevent skewed results. 

Outliers: Analyzing and addressing extreme values that may be errors or legitimate data points that need to be treated differently. 

2.Presentation: Data Visualization Techniques & Best Practices
